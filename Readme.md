# Slugfest

A fun multiplayer game with offline and online support.

Primarily built to get more experience with Scala.js and Akka.
It's probably more Akka than reasonable but that's intentional for this learning project.


## Backlog

* online server discovery
* fancy UI
* make game, network, view FPS separately configurable
* don't allow clients to control other clients
* make actors immutable
* clean up code & architecture
* offline mode
