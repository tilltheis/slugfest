# Slugfest

A fun multiplayer game with offline and online support.

Primarily built to get more experience with Scala.js and Akka.
It's probably more Akka than reasonable but that's intentional for this learning project.

Most of the code is very ugly and hacky because the focus of this project is to get familiar with new technologies.
Cleaning up the code will be done once the core features have stabilized. 


## Backlog

* allow users to disconnect from lobby
* make game, network, view FPS separately configurable
* don't allow clients to control other clients
* make actors immutable
* clean up code & architecture
* offline mode
